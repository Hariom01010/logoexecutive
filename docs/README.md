### Clone and run the project locally
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TeamShiksha/openlogo.git
   cd openlogo
   pnpm install
   pnpm start
   ```

### Environment variables

Most of the environment variables can be used by copying them from the `.env.example` file. However, if you are trying to run the business APIs locally, you will need some additional environment variables associated with AWS.

### Get the AWS environment variables

- Create a stack using `cloudformation_dev_test.yml` file given inside `server/aws` directory.
- You can generate the private and public RSA key by following the instructions given [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html).
- After the stack creation is successful you can find most environmental variables under the `Output` section which are mentioned below:
   - `BUCKET_NAME`
   - `BUCKET_REGION`
   - `KEY`
   - `DISTRIBUTION_DOMAIN`
   - `CLOUD_FRONT_KEYPAIR_ID`
   - `ACCESS_KEY`
   - `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

    **NOTE**: These values will be comma seperated.
